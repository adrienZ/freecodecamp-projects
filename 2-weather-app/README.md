## Weather App

### Show the Local Weather

**[DEMO LINK](https://adrienz.github.io/freecodecamp-projects/2-weather-app/)**

- **Objective**: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: <http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV>.
- **Rule #1**: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.
- **Rule #2**: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
- **User Story**: I can see the weather in my current location.
- **User Story**: I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.
- We recommend using the Open Weather API. This will require creating a free API key. Normally you want to avoid exposing API keys on CodePen, but we haven't been able to find a keyless API for weather.
