# Free Code camp Projects

## Easy Twitch

### Use the Twitchtv JSON API

- **Objective**: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: <https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/Myvqmo/>.
- **Rule #1**: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.
- **Rule #2**: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
- **User Story**: : I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.
- **User Story**: I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.
- **User Story**: if a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.
- **User Story**: I will see a placeholder notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account (or the account never existed). You can verify this works by adding brunofin and comster404 to your array of Twitch streamers.
- **Hint #1**: Here's a URL you can use to get a random Wikipedia article: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random`.
- **Hint #2**: Here's an entry on using Wikipedia's API: `https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page`.
- **Hint #3**: Use this link to experiment with Wikipedia's API.
